# gf-cost-compare

Millions of people in the USA suffer from celiac disease or medically diagnosed gluten intolerances 
and have to pay on average hundreds of dollars more for groceries each year than people without these food requirements. 
The US tax code allows writing off gluten-free food that is "in excess of the cost of the gluten containing food 
that you are replacing", however this is a difficult task since people with these conditions are not replacing any 
food, but simply buying their groceries. I am creating an application that will simplify this process 
by finding comparable non gluten-free items and show the amount you may write off for the gluten-free item.
